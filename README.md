## ðŸ“˜ Ensemble Methods Notebooks

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that provide a detailed explanation and hands-on implementation of **Ensemble Learning techniques** in Machine Learning.

### 1. Introduction to Ensemble Methods
- Overview of ensemble learning and why it improves model performance.  
- Explanation of **Bagging**, **Boosting**, and **voting** approaches.  
- Key advantages such as reducing variance, handling overfitting, and improving accuracy.  
- Simple illustrative examples to build intuition.

### 2. Practical Implementation of Ensemble Models
- Hands-on coding with popular ensemble algorithms:  
  - **Random Forest** (Bagging)  
  - **AdaBoost** (Boosting)  
  - **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**  
  - **XGBoost**   
- Comparison of model performance on sample datasets.  
- Visualizations of feature importance and decision boundaries.  
- Tips on hyperparameter tuning for better results.
